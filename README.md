## Not finished

Things I haven't finished:

1. Unit tests

Although few unit tests exist as an example, I haven't covered 100% of the app as I've ran out of time.

## Main issues

I've spend a lot of time fighting my environment, specifically ts,vite, jest configurations.
I've decided to use Vite for this project as an experiment, which mostly was successful.
